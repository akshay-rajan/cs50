Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The men's world cup predictions didn't even come close to the actual results. The women's predictions were closer to the results.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

10000 is good enough.
