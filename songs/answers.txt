The audio aura can be calculated using their average energy, valence and danceability.
+-------------+
| AVG(energy) |
+-------------+
| 0.65906     |
+-------------+
+--------------+
| AVG(valence) |
+--------------+
| 0.484443     |
+--------------+

| AVG(danceability) |
+-------------------+
| 0.71646           |
+-------------------+
The listener is characterized by high energy, high danceability but average valence.

The calculation is not optimal, since the frequency that the listener plays each song is not considered.
If the listener listens to a particular type of songs more frequently, that effects may not be seen simply by taking average.
